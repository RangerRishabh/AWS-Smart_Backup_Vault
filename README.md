# AWS-Smart_Backup_Vault
# **Smart Backup Vault** 🛠️☁️  

**Smart Backup Vault** is an **automated EC2 backup solution** designed to ensure **data protection, cost optimization, and operational efficiency** using AWS services. This project leverages **EBS snapshots**, **Lambda**, **EventBridge**, **SNS**, and **CloudWatch** to create, manage, and monitor backups dynamically.  

## **🚀 Features & Workflow:**  
1️⃣ **Tag-Based Backup Approach** – Easily add/remove EC2 instances from the backup schedule without modifying code.  
2️⃣ **Automated Snapshot Creation & Deletion** – A **Lambda function** scans instances with a backup tag, creates snapshots, and deletes old ones beyond the retention period.  
3️⃣ **Event-Driven Execution** – **Amazon EventBridge** triggers the backup process automatically at predefined intervals.  
4️⃣ **Real-Time Notifications** – **Amazon SNS** sends alerts for successful or failed backups.  
5️⃣ **Monitoring & Cost Optimization** – **CloudWatch** tracks snapshot count and storage usage, ensuring efficient resource utilization.  

## **🔧 AWS Services Used:**  
- **EC2** – Instances for which snapshots are created  
- **EBS Snapshots** – Incremental backups for storage efficiency  
- **Lambda** – Automates backup and cleanup operations  
- **EventBridge** – Triggers scheduled backups  
- **SNS** – Sends backup notifications  
- **CloudWatch & CloudTrail** – Monitors snapshot count and activity  

## **📌 Future Scope:**  
- Implement **S3-based cross-region backups** for enhanced disaster recovery.  

This project is a **reliable, automated, and cost-effective** backup solution for cloud-based workloads. Contributions and feedback are welcome! 🚀💡
